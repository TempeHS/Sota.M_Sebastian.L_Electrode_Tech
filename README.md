## The aim of our project
Our aim is to design a functional, practical and affordable prosthetic arm for those who have lost their upper limbs. The primary goal for this product is to improve the daily lives of upper limb amputees by restoring essential functions and more, using our high-quality prosthetics which are practical for many use scenarios. The prosthetic arm is intended to improve the quality of life of users through thoughtful and modern design, to create a positive impact for our users by restoring physical capability, emotional comfort and independence. 

## Features 
The hand will feature adjustable grip strength relative to the electric signals sent from the myoelectric sensors, and the ability to open and close fingers, being capable of performing fine motor skills and picking up moderate amounts of weight. The frame is built out of a lightweight aluminium-based alloy, ensuring that the arms is both lightweight and durable for daily wear. Parts such as hands and forearm will be modular for easy replacement. It is customizable with a silicon skin- like finish, varying in multiple skin colours. Using ergonomic padding, the arm will comfortably fit on different sized arms which are then secured by a strap.
